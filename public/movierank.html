<h3><p>Asteroid City- movie summary</p></h3>
<p> Asteroid City (2023), directed by Wes Anderson, is a whimsical and visually stylized film set in a fictional 1950s desert town where 
    a junior stargazers' convention is being held. The story follows a group of eccentric characters—scientists, students, parents,
    and military personnel—who gather for this event, only to experience an unexpected alien encounter that leads to the town being
    quarantined.

    The film blends Anderson's signature quirky humor, meticulous visual design, and heartfelt moments as it explores themes of isolation,
     human connection, and the search for meaning in a world of uncertainty. With an ensemble cast and offbeat narrative, Asteroid City 
     is a charming, surreal meditation on life, love, and the universe.

<p>Poor Things (2023), directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, is a darkly comedic and surreal reimagining of the Frankenstein story, 
    based on the novel by Alasdair Gray. The film follows Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by a brilliant but
     eccentric scientist, Dr. Godwin Baxter, after her tragic death. With a new life and an uninhibited sense of curiosity, 
     Bella embarks on a journey of self-discovery, love, and freedom, defying societal norms.

    As Bella explores the world, she grapples with questions of identity, desire, and independence. 
    Her character evolves from an innocent, childlike state to a bold, empowered woman determined to shape her own destiny. 
    Poor Things is a visually striking, absurd, and thought-provoking exploration of personal transformation and liberation.
